# Calculator-Tkinter-
Implementation of a simple calculator with "Tkinter" library. I did it couple months ago to learn a little bit about the "Tkinter".

# How to run
You need to open the linux prompt, move to the directory that have the "calcTk.py" file and run the code typing "python3 calcTk.py".
